This course was taken in the University of Michigan, Fall 2021. It discusses the history of Western Europe from 235 when the 3rd Century Crisis emerged, to the Norman Conquest in 1066. It partially talks about Eastern Empire and the Islamic World, which were also considered as inherits of legacies of Roman Empire.

這是我在密歇根大學上的歷史課, 講述的是從235年三世紀危機出現, 直到1066諾曼征服英格蘭的西歐歷史, 部分涉及東帝國和伊斯蘭世界 (它們都可以視作羅馬帝國遺產的繼承者). 

實際上內容和耶魯的那個 ([The Early Middle Ages](https://oyc.yale.edu/NODE/171)) 幾乎一樣, 但是UM的老師比那個老師好. 後來我也把耶魯那個聽完了.
